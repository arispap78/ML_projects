# ML_projects
 These are the projects i have done for the class "Statistical learning" in MSc "Computer vision and Computational Intelligence". They are machine learning methods focused on dimensionality reduction. The methods that were used are PCA, kernelPCA, LDA and graph embedding with ISOMAP and LLE. Also there was used Spectral Clusterring for clustering technique of two of the datasets(mnist,segmentation).
